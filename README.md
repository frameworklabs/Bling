# Coding

This project uses the synchronous programming language Blech to simplify timed and concurrent tasks typical for embedded systems.
It uses the Blech module system to provide common helpers and an abstraction of the used Arduino APIs.

This project uses PlatformIO and requires the Blech toolchain to be setup. Please refer to the corresponding installation instructions.
The provided extra script compile_blech.py enables the automatic compilation of Blech files into .h/.c files which are then picked up
automatically by the PlatformIO toolchain making the Blech compilation phase seamless.
